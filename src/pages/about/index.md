Red Barn is a full-service civil engineering, construction management, and environmental firm with a focus on bringing the right team together.  Our team is built of project managers that are accountable, possess strong quality management, and are fun to work with. We make sure our team gets the job done well.

​It was established in 2016 and obtained over 50 permits that year, related to stormwater regulations which had just been adopted on a wide variety of projects.  From there we built the construction management division and have expanded to environmental permitting and water resources engineering.  Red Barn knows the right balance and has timing that synchronizes with our client's desires and the regulatory requirements.  Our core services of construction management, environmental permitting, water resource engineering, and civil design complement each other and work in tandem to give us a comprehensive understanding of each project's environmental and design issues.  

 We have world-class modeling experts in hydrology and hydraulics that understand the benefits of green stormwater infrastructure and the reduction of CSO overflows.  Our construction managers have worked on large facilities and bridges, and our wetlands and fish biologists have worked on over 100 culvert projects.
