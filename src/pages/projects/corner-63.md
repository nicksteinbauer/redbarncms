Red Barn provided support for the underground electrical permitting and franchise agreements for this  140 unit building, of which 28 units would be designated as affordable. 

Corner 63 is within walking distance to numerous retail shops, restaurants, and bike paths, making it a perfect location. The addition of the Roosevelt Light Rail Station will draw much attention to the area.
