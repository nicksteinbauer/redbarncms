TALI Hall is the second project on the Eastside Preparatory campus for which Red Barn Staff has been selected as the lead civil engineer. The project included the design and construction of a new performing arts and theater building. In addition to providing civil services, Red Barn assisted with documents and approvals for additional parking lots and stairs at another campus to expedite student relocation. Red Barn prepared a queueing diagram and signage for the temporary school facility down the street, demolition permits, coordinated directly with Frontier for fiber optic rerouting and prepared and coordinated the SEPA application. Many of the tasks for the school required a team that was flexible and able to adapt. 

Red Barn successfully executed this 18-month project by phasing the construction and pulling the shoring and excavation permits before the building permit. The team had a clear understanding of the school's deadlines by working with the City.
