Telecom services include coordination with other franchise utility owners, energy corporations, municipalities, and private property owners.  Before designing the expansion of telecom in these areas, we obtain surveyors from local surveying firms and assess whether we can bore for the connection to the node locations.  We provide complete permitting and pothole coordination for projects, negotiations, right-of-way management (i.e., discussions with property owners, cities, and utility owners), and traffic control permitting as well as traffic control services.   

In Seattle, WA, we are the team that assists in getting complex poles put in place. (i.e., areaways, SDOT permitting, traffic control planning).  Red Barn is actively pursuing multiple Seattle Department of Transportation UMP (Utility Major Permit) submittals for 5G telecom pole replacements.  Several 5G permits have already been secured/approved on behalf of our wireless client.
