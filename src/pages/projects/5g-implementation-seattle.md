Red Barn provides various services to assist with placing complex poles throughout the City, including areaways, Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) permitting, and traffic control planning. We actively pursue multiple SDOT Utility Major Permit submittals for 5G telecom pole replacements. Several 5G permits have already been secured and approved on behalf of our wireless client.

Red Barn's telecom services include coordination with other franchise utility owners, energy corporations, municipalities, and private property owners. Before designing the expansion of telecom in these areas, we obtain surveyors from local surveying firms and assess whether we can bore for the connection to the node locations. We provide complete permitting and pothole coordination for projects, negotiations, right-of-way management (i.e., discussions with property owners, cities, and utility owners), and traffic control permitting, as well as traffic control services.
