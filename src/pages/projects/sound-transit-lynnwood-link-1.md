Red Barn is providing environmental compliance monitoring during the construction of Sound Transitâ€™s Lynnwood Link Extension. This transit project stretches nearly 10-miles through multiple jurisdictions and critical area resources (22 wetlands and six streams). We are on-site daily, reviewing compliance with permit conditions, conducting stormwater monitoring, and documenting site conditions. Red Barn is also monitoring wetland mitigation site grading, installation of habitat structures, and plantings. We have provided fish removal at the mitigation site and oversee the stream diversion installation per the WDFW HPA.
