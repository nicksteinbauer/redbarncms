Named after the Norwegian immigrant, Thea Foss, the founder of Foss Maritime (now the largest tugboat company in the western United States), the Foss Waterway is the home to the Museum of Glass, the last place Tall Ships regularly pull into Port in the Northwest. 

Red Barn is currently working on four projects, including five hundred housing units, with stormwater discharge into the waterway. Our expertise in biological assessments and environmentally friendly roofing will be crucial to successful project completion. The Foss Waterway was previously designated a Superfund Site in the early ’80s by the EPA, and maintaining the renewed integrity of that environment is paramount.

Presently, we are completing a biological assessment for a HUD-funded project within the Thea Foss Basin. Our experience working with fisheries and our knowledge of endangered species will prove crucial to successful project completion. 

Red Barn will utilize its knowledge of environmentally friendly roofing systems to make sure that the appropriate materials and processes are used at these project sites (i.e., coating galvanized materials, installing BTS roofing).
