Red Barn is currently working on many improvements for the City of Seattle, including sewer rehabilitation, CIPP lining, permitting, green stormwater infrastructure, and options analysis for a culvert replacement. Red Barn knows SDOT permitting and processes, ensures the team has the permit packages ready to go, and actively works with stakeholders to determine the permitting requirements. Our Right-of-Way Management Division is leading the improvements.
