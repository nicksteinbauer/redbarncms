Red Barn staff provided civil engineering for the new Washington Realtors headquarters across from the Capitol campus.  Services included erosion control, pervious paving, temporary excavation, utility – water, sewer, storm alignments, and ADA routing.

This project was used by the City of Olympia as their first project under the new 2016 stormwater manual and utilizing LID to the extent possible.  This location is at the end of the exit from I-5 and is an excellent example for future development within the city limits of making development green.
