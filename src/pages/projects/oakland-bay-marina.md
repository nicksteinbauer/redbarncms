A perk of coastal living is the abundance of picturesque spots for boating, kayaking, and other recreational pursuits. Shelton, WA, is the western-most town located on the Puget Sound and began life as a logging and agriculture center. Red Barn has teamed with Ecco Design to obtain a grant to perform work on the townâ€™s sewer system and Northwest Environmental to complete improvements to the Oakland Bay Marina.
