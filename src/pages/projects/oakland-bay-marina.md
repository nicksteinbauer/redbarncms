The abundance of picturesque spots for boating, kayaking, and other recreational pursuits is a perk of coastal living. Shelton, Washington, is the western-most town on Puget Sound and began life as a logging and agriculture center. Red Barn has teamed with Ecco Design to obtain a grant to work on the town's sewer system and Northwest Environmental to complete the Shelton Yacht Club improvements.
