Red Barn staff is currently providing construction management services in the roles of the lead civil construction engineer, specialized expertise in dewatering, environmental construction management, construction quality value, and construction inspection for a $3B and approx. 10-mile rail extension project.  The earthwork for the project requires mitigation of a bog, wetland plantings, and fish exclusion for the fish-bearing streams that are crossing through the project.  As the early earthwork required the rough grading to be in place for the large stations for the rail, the Red Barn Team with multiple erosion control specialists has verified the Contractor's work for the 10-mile stretch.

Red Barn's environmental staff are providing environmental compliance support during the construction of the Sound Transit Lynnwood Link. This transit project stretches nearly 10-miles through multiple jurisdictions and critical area resources (22 wetlands and six streams). RBE staff are on-site daily reviewing compliance with permit conditions, conducting stormwater monitoring, and documenting site conditions. Red Barn staff are also monitoring wetland mitigation site grading, installation of habitat structures, and planting and have provided fish removal at the mitigation site.
