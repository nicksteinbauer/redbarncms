Firelands Regional Medical Center, in Sandusky, OH, constructed this facility to consolidate physicians from standalone facilities and centralize testing and associated services. The original parcel consisted of four sub parcels for which Red Barn prepared ALTA, boundary, topographic, and lot combination surveys.

Red Barn prepared site improvement plans for the previous Drug Mart, Papa John, Verizon, and gas station sites. The project required the site to be redeveloped due to the impervious area before construction and the final design . This site initially routed its runoff to regional stormwater based on an adjoining parcel. This approach allowed us to use most of the existing storm sewer with modifications to pick up the low points in the new asphalt parking areas.
