Firelands Regional Medical Center constructed this facility to consolidate physicians from standalone facilities to centralize testing and associated services. The original parcel consisted of 4 parcels which we prepared an ALTA survey, boundary, topographic, and lot combination surveys.

Red Barn prepared site improvement plans for the previous drug mart, Papa John, Verizon, and gas station sites. We were able to justify the project as a redevelopment site due to the impervious area prior to construction and the impervious area for the final design.  This site initially routed its runoff to regional stormwater based on an adjoining parcel. This approach allowed us to use most of the existing storm sewer with modifications to pick up the low points in the new asphalt parking areas.
