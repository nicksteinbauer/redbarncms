Red Barn’s expertise in navigating the permit process contributed to successfully completing the Seattle Boat Company’s new fuel pier at their Lake Union Skylaunch Facility. Building on waterfront property comes with a unique set of challenges and requirements. By proactively coordinating with the City of Seattle Shoreline Land Use Planner and the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, Red Barn ensured the acquisition of all stormwater and fuel containment permits. The fuel pier’s integrated concession stand was designed and created through a Seattle-based Ecco Architecture and Design partnership.
