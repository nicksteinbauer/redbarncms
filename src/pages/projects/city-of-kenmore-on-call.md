Red Barn is providing site inspection for engineering permits with the City of Kenmore's Development Services Department. Our site inspector coordinates with developers and contractors on behalf of the City and is required to attend pre-construction meetings, respond to inspection requests, provide inspection reports, and approve minor changes to the engineering design based on field conditions, as needed. Projects inspected include single-family and multi-family residences, clearing and grading activities, plat improvements, and office/institutional buildings.
