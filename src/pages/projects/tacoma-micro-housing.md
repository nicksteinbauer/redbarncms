The 104-unit project was completed with koz developers for affordable student housing across the street from UW Tacoma and within walking distance of the downtown rail system.  This project had a high groundwater table that resulted in keeping the footings high. The site has over 20-feet in elevation change from the west to the east.  Frontage improvements consisted of a new sidewalk, street lighting, ADA ramp design with curb bulbs, and realigning the drainage system in the street.  Red Barn was the lead civil engineer and led coordination with Tacoma Power and Tacoma Water for the project.
