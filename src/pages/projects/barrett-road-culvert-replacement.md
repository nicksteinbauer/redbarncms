Red Barn's environmental staff conducted a wetland and ordinary high water mark (OHWM) delineation. We evaluated wetlands and streams according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources wetland and stream rating manuals. We also prepared the US Army Corps of Engineers nationwide permit and Coastal Zone Management permit for replacing an undersized culvert under Barrett Road.
