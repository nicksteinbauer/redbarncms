Rebekah Weston was the lead civil engineer for this City Hall project. This required collaboration with a state highway job for sidewalks and bike lanes and relocation of utilities. She designed the ADA grading for the exterior of the building and state-of-the-art green stormwater infrastructure. The green stormwater infrastructure helped the building achieve LEED Silver accreditation.
