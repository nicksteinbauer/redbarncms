In 2020 Red Barn opened its second coastal office in Sandusky, Ohio, on Lake Erie's shores. One of the main attractions along the water is the Cedar Point Amusement Park and Resort. Our team's work on the Cedar Point Toll Booth project earned Red Barn the 2020 Ohio Concrete Project of the Year.

Red Barn's acquisition of Hancock & Associates has allowed Red Barn to partner with Bowling Green State University in developing a Resort Management Infrastructure course for the University's new Resort Management Program. Red Barn is proud to give back to the local community, provide opportunities for a new generation of Resort Managers to gain valuable work experience, and support local business development.

We have very close ties to the Sandusky area. Therefore, we are interested in local efforts to enrich the natural environment and prevent sediment and erosion issues along the shoreline. Our next project in Sandusky aims to increase the depth of Sandusky Bay and remove sediment buildup from Pipe Creek and Plumbrook Creek, which discharge into the bay. Red Barn's extensive knowledge and experience in coastal permitting, haul route optimization, and in-water work using barges and floating silt booms will enable timely project completion with an exceptional quality of work achieved.
