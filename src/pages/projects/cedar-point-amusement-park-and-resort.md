The Sandusky office staff has a long history of providing a wide variety of assistance to the resort. We have prepared topographic surveys for attractions and facilities within the park, roller coaster foundation staking, site improvements for park and resort expansions. We assisted outside the park on the Marinas submerged land leases, 5-mile-long roadway widening and resurfacing, shoreline revetment, employee housing, and hotel renovations. The park has multiple areas: Cedar Point Park, Lake Erie Shore Water Park, the Historic Hotel Breakers with its sand beach, Cedar Point Marina, Breakers Express, Employee Housing, and Castaway Bay Resort and Indoor Water Park.  Our team's work on the Cedar Point Toll Booth project earned Red Barn the 2020 Ohio Concrete Project of the Year.
