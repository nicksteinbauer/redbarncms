Red Barn secured a national site development service and architecture/engineering prime agreement with our wireless client in Orlando, FL, and is pursuing current and future work for 5G implementation in core market cities such as the Orlando metro area.

Red Barn's telecom services include coordination with other franchise utility owners, energy corporations, municipalities, and private property owners. Before designing the expansion of telecom in these areas, we obtain surveyors from local surveying firms and assess whether we can bore for the connection to the node locations. We provide complete permitting and pothole coordination for projects, negotiations, right-of-way management (i.e., discussions with property owners, cities, and utility owners), and traffic control permitting as well as traffic control services.
