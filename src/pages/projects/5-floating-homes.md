Floating houses are an iconic part of the Seattle waterfront and can present unique challenges to residents and designers. Providing residents with access to parking and utilities can be complex.

Red Barn teamed up with Ecco Design to supply five floating homes on Portage Bay with utilities and needed infrastructure, including water and electricity, and a beautiful garden-topped parking structure built into a slope adjacent to the shoreline. In cooperation with Seattle City Light, we developed the electrical cabinet loadings and the conduit spacing configuration beneath the new dock.

Red Barn obtained a permit for stormwater discharge and a permit from the Seattle Department of Transportation that allowed work to comply with city regulations. The work included installing an isolation valve to accommodate the existing water system and boring a new water service line through the hill to the homes without trenching.
