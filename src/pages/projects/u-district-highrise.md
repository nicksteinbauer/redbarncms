Red Barn supplies civil engineering services for this 42-story, mixed-use building in Seattle for approximately 200 units.  The project requires coordination with SDOT for the King County bus layover station, light rail pedestrian routes, and re-grading the alley. There is a 20-foot grade difference across the street with existing large retaining walls. Red Barn works with the geotechnical engineer, architect, landscape architect, structural engineer, and owner to develop innovative solutions to issues related to the foundation of the building.
