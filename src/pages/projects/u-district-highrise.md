Red Barn supplied civil engineering services for a 42-story mixed-use building with approximately 200 units. The project required coordination with SDOT for the King County bus layover station, light rail pedestrian routes, and re-grading the alley. There was a 20-foot grade difference across the street with existing large retaining walls. Red Barn worked with the geotechnical engineer, architect, landscape architect, structural engineer, and owner to develop innovative solutions to issues related to the foundation of the building.
