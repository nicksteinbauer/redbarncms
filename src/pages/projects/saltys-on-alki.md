Nestled into the western bank of Elliot Bay, the iconic Salty's on Alki restaurant faced a potentially severe structural threat to its building, with the subfloor beginning to subside by more than a foot in deviation. Red Barn and NOAA worked together on all environmental permitting, assessing the property and roof for any contaminants that could migrate into the bay via stormwater.

Salty's is a pillar in the Seattle community. Red Barn's stormwater design and environmental permitting work have helped ensure that Salty's on Alki will continue to be one of the most popular restaurants in the City.
