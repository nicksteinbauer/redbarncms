Encompassing over eight square miles, Elliot Bay is where the City of Seattle began. A coveted diving location, the bay is home to an abundance of marine wildlife that flourishes along the pristine shoreline. In addition to the sea life, many prominent community sites and businesses call the water’s edge their home, including the Iconic restaurant chain, Salty’s. Nestled into the western bank of Elliot Bay, Salty’s on Alki was facing a potentially severe structural threat to their building. With the subfloor beginning to subside by more than a foot in deviation, Red Barn and NOAA worked together on all environmental permitting - assessing the property and roof for any contaminants that could migrate into the bay via stormwater.

Salty’s is a pillar in the Seattle community. Red Barn’s stormwater design and environmental permitting work have helped ensure that Salty’s on Alki will continue to be one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
