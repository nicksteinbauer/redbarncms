Our drainage team provides plans and reports to architects, developers, and homeowners. We have completed over 400 drainage permits in 5 years and understand the analysis in many different codes for different regions across the U.S.

Red Barn has experts in drainage design, reports, planning, monitoring, and custom water quality design mixes.  We are one of the firms leading this area with our new laboratory set up for long-term media studies that evaluate predictability to exhaustion.  We have completed work with flash flooding environments to very sensitive ecological areas.  Our team understands the dynamics of the downstream condition and works to provide a sustainable solution both financially and physically. 

Our experts can prepare HUD documents to look at the building materials and prepare the biological assessment and consultation with USFS/NOAA as required.  We are your drainage team and understand the nuances of code requirements and blend that with sustainable solutions.
