Our drainage team provides plans and reports to architects, developers, and homeowners. We have obtained more than 400 drainage permits in five years and understand the analysis of many different codes for different regions of the United States. 

Red Barn has experts in drainage design, reports, planning, monitoring, and custom water quality design mixes.  We are one of the firms leading this area with our new laboratory set up for long-term media studies that evaluate predictability to exhaustion.  We have completed work with flash flooding environments to very sensitive ecological areas.  Our team understands the dynamics of the downstream condition and works to provide a sustainable solution both financially and physically. 

Our experts can prepare HUD documents to look at the building materials and prepare the biological assessment and consultation with USFS/NOAA as required.  We are your drainage team and understand the nuances of code requirements and blend that with sustainable solutions.
