Leading large transit and transportation projects is what our qualified team members do best. Red Barn structures its teams so that construction management and constructability reviews are being conducted throughout the life of the project. The breadth of experience our in-house experts have in heavy civil construction ensures peace of mind and a project well executed.

Our team is led by construction managers and inspectors with over 20 years of experience in heavy civil construction. They know how to get the job coordinated, reviewed, and moving forward.

Our primary focus is bringing the right team to the project. Darin Stephens, who heads this division, was the supervisory construction manager for five of the Seattle Department of Transportation's mega-bridge projects. His knowledge and ability to lead a team results in obtaining clean audits.
