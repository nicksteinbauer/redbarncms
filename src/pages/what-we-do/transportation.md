Red Barn has qualified staff able to lead large projects for transit and transportation. Our team is structured so that construction management and constructability reviews are done throughout the project.  Additionally, we look over submittals and RFI responses from the contractor.

Our team is led by construction managers and inspectors with over 20 years of experience in heavy civil construction. They know how to get the job coordinated, reviewed, and moving forward.

Our primary focus is bringing the right team to the project. Darin Stephens, who heads this division, was the supervisory construction manager for five of the Seattle Department of Transportation's mega-bridge projects. His knowledge and ability to lead a team results in obtaining clean audits.
