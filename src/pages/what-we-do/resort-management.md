Red Barn staff is experienced in working on commercial site plans and site design. This experience transfers over to Resort Management with entrance drives, parking lots, site plans, stormwater management, and other site amenities. These elements together allow for a cohesive site and pleasant experience. We have been fortunate to assist an amusement park in Sandusky, OH, over the years by preparing topographic surveys and site design. Our latest noteworthy projects impacted all the traffic entering and exiting the park.

**Prioritization for Capital Funding**
We have a working relationship with local contractors that we work with to understand the latest site work and maintenance services costs.  In addition, our team is here to help private sector clients design and implement a permitting strategy that ensures an expedited process for infrastructure replacement projects. 

**Permitting**
We can provide permitting support with local and State jurisdictions for permits on the project timeline.  Our environmental permitting team understands permit strategy, environmental compliance, and code requirements.\
(NEPA, SEPA, BA, QAPP, ESA Consultation).
