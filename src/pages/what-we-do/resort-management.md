The uniqueness of theme park projects requires a team of experts experienced with this type of work. We bring just that! Red Barn team members are experienced in developing commercial site plans, site design, and customized maintenance programs for resorts, theme parks, and seaside or waterfront projects. We bring together the right team, working with landscape architects, architects, roller coaster engineers, and other specialists to design complementary walkways and concourses for your theme park attractions.

Red Barn’s site development team has experience with coastal projects and marina design (utility systems dock gangways, fuel pier, and slip layout), embankment, revetment, dams, dredging, and other shoreline-related work. We work with you to better understand and navigate the critical habitats associated with shorelines.
