Red Barn has a history of working on complex optimization problems that involve understanding environmental risk, pipeline design, pipeline monitoring, and wellfield development in shales and fractured rock.  As the oil and gas industry depends on monitoring complex dynamics, Red Barn knows how to work within a team environment and provides the backbone of the system analysis for both staffing and field assessment and yields.  We team with strategic partners and aid in inspection and documentation of large projects through our construction management team for heavy civil projects and pipeline engineering for transmission mains.
