description: Our firm started in 2016 with construction management and civil
  engineering as core service areas.  From the first day of conception, we have
  been serving businesses with construction management that included inspection,
  change management, resident engineering, and support during claim
  negotiations.  Our services have grown to provide construction engineering, QV
  management, inspection, environmental construction management, monitoring,
  compliance, and documentation.  Red Barn’s CM Division focuses on modes of
  transportation.  We provide a team of construction professionals ranging from
  construction managers, inspectors, resident engineers, quality assurance
  managers, schedulers, and environmental construction engineers. Our firm also
  provides environmental and civil engineering services integrated into your
  project if conditions require additional support.
