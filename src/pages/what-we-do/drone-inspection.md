At Red Barn, we push technological boundaries using our robust programmers and advanced modeling engineers. Our drone pilot has world-renowned flight status and compiles data for engineers, scientists, and real estate land development. We cut the time down to minutes, not hours, of field time.

**How does it work?**

1. Contact our drone pilot.
2. A contract is put in place.
3. We email you within 24 hours of your scheduled flight.
4. We obtain the required flight clearance and make certain the area is secure before the flight.
5. We fly.
6. We notify you when we are finished, and your files are delivered to the engineer.
