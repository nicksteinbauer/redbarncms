Red Barn's survey division has drone technology that aids in picking up utility locate marks and calculate earthwork quantities during construction.  It has been an invaluable resource as we use high-resolution imaging to look at large sites and sites with steep slopes.  The drone technology team is constantly working on new ways to perform maintenance and inspection on bridges, tunnels, and steep slopes.  We have drone pilots with over 20 years of experience in both videography and data analysis of results.  We provide drone services for the following types of projects: 

•	Special Inspections (lift cables)  
•	Bridge Super Structure and Decking  
•	Roof Skylights  
•	Large land development projects (over 100 acres)  
•	Commercial projects (where tree interference is minimized)  
•	Utility locates for long linear jobs  
•	Data Analysis with 5G systems
