Red Barn's Right-of-Way Consulting team coordinates with jurisdictions the needs of your project, particularly - dedications, easements, temporary construction easements, property research, title report due diligence, utility backchecking, and right-of-entry coordination.  We are working on contracts for both public and private entities for many different facilities within the right-of-way.  Our priority is to keep our clients informed of the impacts and the best approach to building within the right-of-way and work with Real Property divisions where work may require easements for other stakeholders. We also work with assessors and right-of-way acquisition specialists to determine the value of property and easements and manage that process. Our staff has overseen the acquisitions and needs of many multi-billion dollar transit projects to smaller site development projects.  We understand that issues arise on large and small projects, and we have a team of real estate experts that can walk you through this process.
