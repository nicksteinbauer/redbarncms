Originally from China, Wendy graduated from a pharmaceutical university and worked as a scientist, while in China. Eventually, she realized that the kind of work she tailored with science didn’t provide for the same thrill she discovered in the world of financing. Wendy left the lab in pursuit of accounting and found an opportunity to bring to her work a critical eye and passion for numbers at Red Barn. Wendy is a fanatic about details. She comes to Red Barn with a focus on managing payroll and is quickly gaining experience in project invoicing.
