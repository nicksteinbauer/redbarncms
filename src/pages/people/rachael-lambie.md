Rachael Lambie has over 20 years of Project Management, Development, and Telecommunications experience.  Her insight, from a client’s perspective, is strong, having served 16 years as Senior Development Manager for a private developer of institutional-quality multifamily, mixed-use apartment projects.  In that role, she was responsible for the apartment development process from land acquisition, entitlement, and design through to construction completion and had direct involvement in the development of 13 apartment properties totaling over 2,900 units in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. She managed the entitlement process on identified properties, coordinating between senior management, consultants, and municipalities, including design development, permit review/approval processes, securing required zoning/planning bonds, coordination of incentive zoning program compliance requirements. Her telecommunications experience began while working for a large Chicago law firm and expanded during her tenor as a real estate developer in the areas of "white space" apartment community design such as access control, internal wiring for media, and networking.  She has strong organizational skills and respects the attention to detail/communication required to ensure successful project completion.
