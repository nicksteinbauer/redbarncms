Rob has provided natural resources, fisheries biology, and environmental management services for over 25 years. His areas of expertise include fisheries and wildlife habitat evaluation and design, fish passage and habitat enhancement projects, fish exclusion, wetland enhancement, Endangered Species Act (ESA) compliance, State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) compliance, Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) compliance, and best management practices (BMPs) for road construction and maintenance activities. Robert has overseen staff in small to large scale projects involving scientific research, environmental monitoring, and environmental cleanup related projects for the King County Department of Transportation, spanning over two decades. He has written construction guidelines, worked with contractors, and understands that each site is unique and proposes different challenges. Additionally, Rob has worked for the Muckleshoot Tribe and USFWS. He understands the details of what it takes to make a stream fish passable, even in parts that may not be currently accessible due to downstream fish barriers. Rob brings expertise in overseeing a contractor with work in critical areas and making sure that the sites comply with all regulatory agencies.
