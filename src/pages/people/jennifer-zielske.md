Jennifer is a basin modeler working in SWMM and MGS Flood and quantifying water flow for conveyance and water quality treatment. Basin modeling is important to her because it helps her understand the risks within a watershed to avoid catastrophic failure of roads and infrastructure. She is happy to be on the Red Barn team to develop her hydraulic skills further.
