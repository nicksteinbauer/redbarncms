Jana is the Principal Stormwater Lead for Red Barn Engineering with over 20 years of experience in the Puget Sound region.  She has a Bachelor of Science degree from The Evergreen State College.  She worked for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for 17 years in the stormwater program.  Jana has experience with stormwater monitoring during construction and post-construction, erosion control, TMDLs, stormwater mapping/inventory, WSDOT’s Highway Runoff Manual, and stormwater policy development.  She was regularly tasked with developing strategic solutions to problems associated with stormwater mitigation and/or implementation of stormwater permit requirements, which could affect project timelines and budget.  Jana was also responsible for the overall implementation of the stormwater retrofit program and represented WSDOT as a technical expert on stormwater management on interagency and national forums.  She was the primary agency point of contact related to the 6PPD-quinone/tire toxicity issue and WSDOT’s stormwater management efforts and response to this newly identified toxicant.  Jana is passionate about stormwater work, and she truly enjoys collaborating with others to work toward a common goal of cleaner water.
