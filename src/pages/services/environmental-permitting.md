We have experience preparing environmental documentation through various forms and reports for local, state, and federal permits. Red Barn looks at each project and thoroughly vets the impacts to the environment and identifies mitigation measures. We concentrate on the surface water, land use, and traffic impacts for larger site development projects. We are most interested in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) details for rural transportation projects that significantly impact critical areas. We follow a collaborative process with stakeholders to make sure we understand all perspectives of the work being performed. We guide clients through the best path forward for replacing or repairing critical infrastructure or understanding water body dynamics to ensure water quality compliance in areas where endangered species need protection.
