Red Barn has been active in Green Shores for Homes and revetments for many coastal waterfront projects in multiple areas throughout the US. In particular, the tidally influenced areas have multiple facets in understanding sea-level rise and the impact of driftwood on structures with the currents.  In the Great Lakes region, we are primarily concerned with wave action and freeze-thawing of the lake and rising lake levels.  Revetments have been designed along with the coastal areas of Lake Erie for large commercial projects, marinas, highways, as well as for homeowners.  In 2020, Red Barn acquired a coastal firm that provides survey mappings with GPS, which allows the firm to map critical aquatic species and aid in bathymetry and documentation of sedimentation.
