Red Barn has some of the region's leading experts in fish passage design with over 20 years of experience.  We have experience in soft shore construction, monitoring, and conducting spawning surveys.  Our team works with our Water Division in fish barrier removal. 

**Wetland Biology**

Red Barn has professional wetland scientists that work on large projects.  Much of our work is focused on long linear projects along stream reaches, highways, and rail projects.  Our staff is available nationwide.

**Prioritization for Capital Funding**

We have experts in developing rating matrices on what to next improve or where to invest public funding within a program. Our team is here to help public sector clients design and implement a permitting strategy that ensures an expedited process for infrastructure needing replacement. 

 **Permitting**

We can provide local jurisdictions with the permitting support they need to get in-water permits on time.  Our environmental permitting team understands permit strategy, environmental compliance, and code requirements.   

(NEPA, SEPA, BA, QAPP, ESA Consultation).
