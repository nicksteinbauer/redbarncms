Red Barn has some of the region's leading experts in fish passage design with over 20 years of experience.  We are experienced in soft shore construction, monitoring, and conducting spawning surveys.  Our team works with our Water Division in fish barrier removal.

**Wetland Biology**

Red Barn has professional wetland scientists who work on large projects and are available nationwide.  Much of our work is focused on long linear projects along stream reaches, highways, and rail projects.

**Prioritization for Capital Funding**

We have experts in developing rating matrices on improving or investing public funding within a program. Our team is here to help public sector clients design and implement a permitting strategy that ensures an expedited process for infrastructure needing replacement.

**Permitting**

We can provide local jurisdictions with the permitting support they need to get in-water permits on time.  Our environmental permitting team understands permit strategy, environmental compliance, and code requirements.  (NEPA, SEPA, BA, QAPP, ESA Consultation).
