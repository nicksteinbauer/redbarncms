The Water Division oversees projects related to streams, floodplains, shoreline stability, beach erosion, natural system design, and industrial water quality.  Our modeling team has advanced degrees in environmental fluid dynamics and mathematics and works regularly with professors on published research that differentiate us from our competitors. 

**Hydrology & Hydraulics**

Our team works with multiple flow regimes including HEC-RAS modules for 1D, 2D, and 3D, as well as SWMM modules (XP-SWMM and PCSWMM).  We have modeled basins using HSPF Basins and TR-55 depending on the size and location.  We are also experts in CE-QUAL-W2, GMS, SMS, River2D, and stormwater programs.  Our team uses a practical approach to choosing the level of effort needed for modeling.  We have the ability to model in any software package and have experience with very large systems.

**​Floodplain Restoration/Natural System Design**

As climate change is causing a rise in sea level, our team has both coastal and wetland specialists who consider the full habitat restoration of shorelines and upland floodplains.  We look at channel dynamics, over-banking, bank stability, large woody material, culvert analysis, sediment storage, and how it all works together.  We also have completed projects within the floodplain for additional stormwater storage and have worked with the Corp for wetland reporting associated with the upland areas.

**​Water Quality Permitting and MS4 Permits**

Our staff works with municipalities on getting MS4 permit compliance with monitoring.  Red Barn staff have designed custom water quality treatment media up to 3.5 acres for industrial compliance including hard wiring of controls for closing valves and holding the 25-year event for 24 hours.  We oversee the maintenance and operation manuals, are HAZWOPER trained for sampling, and can meet your needs with design, construction management, and ongoing monitoring.
