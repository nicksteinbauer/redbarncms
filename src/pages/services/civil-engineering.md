Our civil team is a full-service civil engineering team offering expertise in site development, public works projects, and transit jobs.

**Communication**

Our differentiation is communication.  The civil team is well experienced with multi-disciplinary projects.  We work with the team to understand schedule updates as well as coordinate with the design team.  On Mondays, we call, email, and make sure we are providing forward progress on your job.  We encourage feedback as to how we are doing.

**​Technical**

We know the regulations well, from ADA standards to local stormwater regulations. Horizontal control for connecting utilities and pavement is key to working with the contractor. We offer specifications in multiple formats - CSI, SpecsIntact, APWA, and modifications to special municipal provisions.

**​Staffing & Schedules**

In addition to the communication, we have project managers working within the schedules to keep consistent staff on the project from the beginning to the end.

**Field Services & Safety**

The civil team is CESCL-certified and OSHA-10hr trained to see the project through completion.

We are here to help your project go smoothly and to bring peace of mind through the process.
